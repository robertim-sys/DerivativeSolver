This is the website that I (massimo) was working on to be the front end of the derivativeSolver project but I could not
finish figuring out the way to link the html and the python script and I ran out of time. This is just to show what i was
working on and what the front end was going to be.

There is some stuff thats in the css that ended up being unused because I thought I would use it maybe.

the second page is more of a mockup of what the working page would look like. the example problem is 3(2x+1)^2
